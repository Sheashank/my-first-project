    <p>I'm Wave. I am a webdeveloper and a student from india. I'm specialized in the field of WEB3 (fancy enough).<br> Weeks back programming took my interest and i thouhgt web3 was something that i was finally interested in.
    As i was jobless in my home ignoring my Homeworks, i thought i would rather spend my time in researching about Web3 and cryptocurrency which got into my mind as a door to an interesting future of mine.<br> This is my first project and i hope it gets better eventually.<br> I'm verymuch interested in getting your trust and converting it into the value i can deliver. <br>('Wave' is not my real name)</p>
